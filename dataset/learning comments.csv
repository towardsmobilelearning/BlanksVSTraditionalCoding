P3,Fill-in-the-Blank,"No, a lot of the practise problems confused me.","['confusion', 'value_of_practice']",Negative
P4,Fill-in-the-Blank,"Yes, doing practice problems helped me gain confidence and deepen my grasp of the fundamentals of Python.","['confidence_boost', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P5,Fill-in-the-Blank,"I mean it helped me see what goes where and expanded on the video but I felt it learned way more from the video for the final task rather than the practice session, also there was a question that I didn't really understand and didn't get any info from the practice question but it could of just been a personal problem as I just couldn't get my head around it.","['test_preparation', 'structure_recognition', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Neutral
P6,Fill-in-the-Blank,"Yes. By the time I finished the practice problems, I was conversant with the key terminologies used in the tutorial. I also believe the practice problems helped me understand how to structure solutions logically.","['logical_thinking', 'structure_recognition', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice', 'external_resources']",Positive
P7,Fill-in-the-Blank,"yes, it gave me more hands on expeirence with the programming and I had already mastered some issues I first faced",['experiential_learning'],Positive
P8,Fill-in-the-Blank,Yes they definitely did. It gave me the layout and the format of the code. It was then easier to find similar problems from the practice and apply the same structure to the final questions,"['coding_skill', 'test_preparation', 'structure_recognition', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P9,Fill-in-the-Blank,"They have me a little insight into what to expect and how to write out the code in some situations, however the final questions were way more complex and with little to no help and direction they were very difficult.","['coding_skill', 'control_structures', 'test_preparation', 'learning_support']",Negative
P10,Fill-in-the-Blank,"No it did not, we had to go on tutorials instructions only and it was not very clear in comparison to the questions",['external_resources'],Negative
P11,Fill-in-the-Blank,It certainly gave me a bit of both an insight and a warm up. This mainly helped in getting me mentally ready for the challenge which laid ahead. With me being quite knowledgeable I gave this my very best effort.,['learning_support'],Neutral
P12,Fill-in-the-Blank,"I actually don't really think it did. I would say I found it a little easier once I actually got a chance to use the platform and see how it worked. The practice problems mainly frustrated me since I didn't have anyone I could ask for assistance, all I had were videos that I didn't feel helped me entirely. ","['learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Negative
P13,Fill-in-the-Blank,"It did in that it drilled into me the correct formula of writing it out, as the formula was written already it was just filling in the blanks, however when I was in the final test I felt like I didn't know enough about actually writing the correct way to do things. It sort of babied you in a way, and made things easier. If the practice was more like the final test I think I would have found the final test much easier. ","['control_structures', 'test_preparation', 'repetition_benefit', 'value_of_practice']",Negative
P14,Fill-in-the-Blank,"not really. like I said before, I felt the easy ones were okay but then going into the more detailed, ""pi"", radius questions blew my mind. ",['confusion'],Negative
P15,Fill-in-the-Blank,Yes but they were significantly harder,"['control_structures', 'confusion']",Neutral
P16,Fill-in-the-Blank,"Sort of but not really, it made getting the ""flow"" of how you enter things a little easier but that's it.",['confusion'],Negative
P17,Fill-in-the-Blank,Yes very much. Once I learned how to use the questions from the practice test. The test was fairly straightforward. Especially since I could see my mistakes before submitting on the actual test.,"['test_preparation', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P18,Fill-in-the-Blank,"I believe completing the practice problems did help as it helps familiarize one with the formatting and syntax of the language. It slightly helped with the final test, but trying to recall how to add say first + last + year wasn't","['test_preparation', 'syntax_knowledge', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Neutral
P19,Fill-in-the-Blank,"Yes and No.  Yes, when I could remember the things that came up in practice and no when I could not recall them.",['value_of_practice'],Neutral
P20,Fill-in-the-Blank,"Yes, they really helped with either the beginning or end of the codes. I was able to remember how they were inputted in the questions and I tried applying the same method.","['coding_skill', 'learning_support', 'problem_solving_strategy']",Positive
P21,Fill-in-the-Blank,they did help,['learning_support'],Positive
P22,Fill-in-the-Blank,yes They seemed to help me get a feel for writing small string of code.,"['coding_skill', 'learning_support']",Positive
P23,Fill-in-the-Blank,"Yes, as it gave you logical solutions to solve the problems","['logical_thinking', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P24,Fill-in-the-Blank,Yes I think it did help me to understand what I should expect and how to set out the code.,"['coding_skill', 'learning_support']",Neutral
P25,Fill-in-the-Blank,"No, both were very hard.",['confusion'],Negative
P26,Real Programming,I actually think I did better on the practice problems because it came to me in what to do. It did help and the amount of time given was perfect. Thank you for the opportunity this way my first study as this one.,"['learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P27,Real Programming,"Yes, by the time I got to the final test I felt a lot more confident because I'd got to grips with the fundamentals",['test_preparation'],Positive
P28,Real Programming,"Yes, It did help me because I had already run similar programs previously, even though it was a little different.","['control_structures', 'learning_support']",Positive
P29,Real Programming,No. There has to be repetitions of practice ,"['repetition_benefit', 'value_of_practice']",Negative
P30,Real Programming,"Yes, they did. I (hopefully) got better with practice. I at least felt slightly more comfortable with the problems",['value_of_practice'],Positive
P31,Real Programming,"Yes. It helped me get courage to tackle the final test, by completing the practice problems, I gained some clue on how to write the different codes while following the stated instructions, this helped me be confident that I will be able to proceed to the final test.","['coding_skill', 'test_preparation', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice', 'external_resources', 'control_structures']",Positive
P32,Real Programming,sort of...The final was using 2 of the things I learned in 1 code. I dont think I saw how to do that in the training. [?] I didnt do as well on those.,"['coding_skill', 'test_preparation']",Neutral
P33,Real Programming,"Yes, big time! Completing the practice problems allowed me to get into the rhythm of understanding the syntax and helped me flow better in the final test. This helps because for the first 4 to 6 practice questions, it takes a little while for your brain to adjust to this type of syntax, mainly because it feels so confusing at first, like reading a foreign language. But, once again, once you get a hang of it, you almost don't think about what certain syntax means, you'll just automatically type it like you've already been doing it for years!

Very interesting stuff and I would actually love to learn Python some more. Thank you so much for this. And have a great Memorial Day! ","['test_preparation', 'repetition_benefit', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice', 'syntax_knowledge']",Positive
P34,Real Programming,I found the second set of questions easier to answer as they provided a formula in most of the questions,"['value_of_practice', 'test_preparation']",Positive
P35,Real Programming,Yes. I had a chance to practice problems that would come up later in the main test. I really enjoyed working it all out and trying to remember how it all strings together functionally.,"['test_preparation', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P36,Real Programming,"Yeah, sure it helped a lot in preparing for the final test because it provided for me the guidance on how to perform the tasks I was required to do.","['test_preparation', 'learning_support']",Positive
P37,Real Programming,"I’ve felt that they helped me, but just barely. I don’t think I did any of them right, because again, I don’t know anything about coding. It kind of felt like being thrown into a pop quiz at school for something I didn’t learn too much about or the teacher didn’t go over with me ahead of time.","['coding_skill', 'repetition_benefit', 'learning_support']",Neutral
P38,Real Programming,Yes absolutely. It helped me remember the concepts much better because I am a hands-on learner. It allowed me to practice the concepts which made me internalize them much better.I think doing poorly on the practice problems helped me learn from mistakes.,"['learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P39,Real Programming,yes! absolutely ,"['learning_support', 'confidence_boost']",Positive
P40,Real Programming,"I think the practice problems helped, but also did not help at the same time. While they did help me remember a little bit about coding, they were also not very helpful for the final test since there was no feedback on whether I was doing them right or not.","['coding_skill', 'test_preparation', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Neutral
P41,Real Programming,"Yes, the practice problems helped me prepare for the final test tremendously. I spent a significant amount of time on the practice problems because I was determined to get it right. I rewatched the tutorial video countless times and was able to learn all the functions. By the time I got to the final test I did not need to reference the video anymore and coding was much faster. I knew almost exactly how to solve the problems during the test because I recognized similarities from the practice problems. ","['coding_skill', 'test_preparation', 'efficiency_gain', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice', 'external_resources', 'control_structures']",Positive
P42,Real Programming,"Yes. I got a gist of what the final test was all about. In the practice sessions I missed the part that I was supposed to write the codes in Programiz, but I understood that part when I got to the final test. I hope I will not be penalized for that mistake. ","['coding_skill', 'test_preparation', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P43,Real Programming,"Yes, I found that I got better and faster with each problem and the practice questions were not unlike the questions in the final test.","['test_preparation', 'efficiency_gain', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P44,Real Programming,I did the practice tests to help me prepare even though I found them difficult,"['control_structures', 'test_preparation', 'learning_support', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P45,Real Programming,"yes, warmed my brain back up to how do that type of thing","['structure_recognition', 'learning_support']",Positive
P46,Real Programming,"Yes, Actually on the initial practice problems, I still didn't really put two and two together with what I was actually trying to achieve/input/what python was doing for me. Once I started to understand how python was actually working and what I was actually implementing, it became really interesting and I could start to give the challenges a proper go! Some of which I feel like II perfected, others I just couldn't make work! ",['value_of_practice'],Positive
P47,Real Programming,"Totally, without practice it would have been impossible to solve the problems raised",['value_of_practice'],Positive
P48,Real Programming,"Definitely! I had already done lots of trial and errors during the practice problem, and I was able to avoid some time-consuming mistakes that I had encountered during the practice tasks. I also think I well prepared to handle the final test since the questions were quite similar. I only had a challenge with the last two questions, but I could have managed question 4 if I had given it more time. ","['test_preparation', 'experiential_learning', 'error_awareness', 'value_of_practice', 'debugging_skill', 'control_structures']",Positive
P49,Real Programming,"Sure. The final test felt like a continuation of the practice problems. The questions were similar, and I was able to handle 4 of the questions with relative ease. I think the  time spent on the practice problems, including having to watch the tutorial numerous times so I could solve the practice problems, adequately prepared for the final test. ","['external_resources', 'test_preparation', 'value_of_practice']",Positive
P50,Real Programming,definitely. I noticed I made less errors and had to redo things less times in the final test and this I think was because of the trial and errors I made in the practise,"['test_preparation', 'experiential_learning', 'error_awareness', 'efficiency_gain', 'debugging_skill']",Positive
